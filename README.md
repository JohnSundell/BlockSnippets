BlockSnippets
=============

#### Xcode snippets that are very handy when working with blocks in various contexts

Hard to remember all those different ways to type a block in Objective-C, isn't it?

Just install these snippets and you can type ```BLOCK``` anywhere to auto-complete with a block syntax fit for the context you're currently in.

#### Installing

##### Option A: Get the snippets using this command line one-liner:

```$ zsh -c 'unzip -ouj -d ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/CodeSnippets/ =(curl -L https://github.com/JohnSundell/BlockSnippets/zipball/master) "*.codesnippet"'```

The above will download a zip archive of this repo, and move the files into your CodeSnippets folder that Xcode reads from.

##### Option B: Clone & Move the files manually:

After you've cloned the repo, here's how to get these snippets into Xcode:

1. Drag the .codesnippet files into ```~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/CodeSnippets/```

2. Restart Xcode

Congratulations, you're done! Now, try typing ```BLOCK``` anywhere in the editor (where a block can be put).

#### Hope that you'll enjoy using these snippets!
