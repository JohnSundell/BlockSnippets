BlockSnippets
=============

#### Xcode snippets that are very handy when working with blocks in various contexts

Hard to remember all those different ways to type a block in Objective-C, isn't it?

Just install these snippets and you can type ```BLOCK``` anywhere to auto-complete with a block syntax fit for the context you're currently in.

#### Installing

After you've cloned the repo, here's how to get these snippets into Xcode:

##### 1. Drag the .codesnippet files into ```~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/CodeSnippets/```

##### 2. Restart Xcode

Congratulations, you're done! Now, try typing ```BLOCK``` anywhere in the editor (where a block can be put).

#### Hope that you'll enjoy using these snippets!
